**Project Objective:**
This project aims to analyze the human resource situation in a business, focusing on the turnover rate, causes and impacts of personnel fluctuations. The main objective is to provide detailed data to help the management identify turnover trends, assess the stability of the workforce and propose optimal solutions to improve human resource management policies, enhance talent retention and ensure sustainable development of the business.

**Data Source:**
The project uses human resource data including personal information, start date, contract status, and turnover. In addition, indicators such as Attrition Rate, number of employees terminating contracts and reasons for leaving are also analyzed to assess human resource trends.

**Analysis Tools & Methods:**
The report is made with the support of Power BI to calculate, analyze and visualize human resource data. Quantitative analysis methods applied include calculating Attrition Rate, comparing trends by department, seniority and position. In addition, Power BI is used to visualize data, help identify patterns of personnel fluctuations and provide important insights to optimize human resource management and retention strategies in the enterprise.

**Key insights from HR Analytics:**

The number of employees grew strongly from 2015-2019, marking the expansion of the business. The number of employees increased 7 times from 136 to 776 from 2015-2019, mainly from the positions: WMT Web Marketing Specialist, WSS Admissions Consultant, ITS Software Development Specialist..
Turnover rate is at 37.6% averagely, with 50% of employees tend to leave the company within 1 year.
During the period 2008-2014, the turnover rate also fluctuated around 20%, which was not too significant. However, during the period 2015-2019, when the number of employees increased, the turnover rate increased to an alarming level of 40.8%. Compared to companies in the Edtech industry, the company's turnover rate is much higher than the average (20-30%/year). This shows that the turnover rate is not simply due to the general trend of the industry, but may be related to internal factors. 
There is a clear differentiation in the turnover trend by level. Management levels maintain a better level of stability with a turnover rate of only around 30%, while associate and specialist positions have a high turnover rate (60.6% and 40.7%) reflecting the flexible and fast-changing nature of these positions.
This is further demonstrated in the chart of turnover rates by position. The roles of Admission Consultant (WSS), Web Marketing Specialist (WMT) and Online Operations Specialist (GOO) have high numbers of employees but also record high turnover rates, due to the nature of high-pressure work, having to be responsible for short-term sales. Meanwhile, specialized groups such as Data Analytics (IBB) or UI/UX Design (IUU) have low numbers of employees and lower turnover rates, indicating a higher level of stability. This difference emphasizes that positions with high sales pressure and requiring flexibility often have higher turnover rates, requiring businesses to have appropriate support and retention policies.
Regarding reasons why employees leave the job, major answers are "Career support and growth" and "Salary promotion". Recordings are mostly from Admission Consultant, Web MKT Specialist and Online Operations Specialist. Peak months for resignations are March-April and October-November. This also aligns with industry insights that these are the timings that companies has high recruitment needs.
